# Crystal Engine

A Work-in-progress Vulkan game engine with PBR rendering, FrameGraph based render architecture, and a declarative syntax Widget GUI framework that is used by the editor.

### Check more [screenshots below](#screenshots).

### Check out [Fusion widget library](./Docs/FusionWidgets.md).

## Requirements

Only Windows is supported for now. Although, the Core libraries compile on macOS too.

## Building

Please look at the [Build.md](./Docs/Build.md) to know the steps & dependencies required to build.

## Features

- Modular engine architecture.
- Use HLSL to write shaders for Vulkan.
- Forward PBR rendering with CubeMap IBL.
- Directional shadow maps.
- Multi-threaded job system, used in Asset Processing.
- Asset processing to generate binary assets for use by engine.
- Automatic C++ runtime reflection generation.
- Object serialization: Custom binary format and JSON.
- Frame graph based GPU scheduling with automatic resource dependencies.
- **Fusion** framework for declarative GUI apps with text & SDF geometry rendering.
- **Fusion** uses the engine's builtin renderer instead of 3rd party imgui frameworks.

## Modules Overview

The engine is divided into different domains, and each domain can have multiple modules.

### Core domain
All modules inside the core domain are at the low level of the engine.

* **Core**: The foundation of the engine. Provides runtime type reflection system, Binary & JSON serialization, containers, Object system, Job System, etc.
* **CoreApplication**: Low level application layer to handle OS specific application & windowing. Uses SDL2 underneath the abstractions.
* **CoreInput**: Low level input handling.
* **CoreMedia**: Low level image handling and BC1-7 compression.
* **CoreMesh**: Low level mesh loading.
* **CoreShader**: Low level shader compilation and reflection. Uses DxCompiler & spirv reflect.
* **CoreRHI**: Rendering Hardware Interface. A graphics API abstraction layer that is used for low level GPU operations. Also implements frame graph rendering.
    * **VulkanRHI**: Vulkan implementation of the RHI layer.
* **CoreRPI**: Render Pipeline Interface. Provides a render pipeline architecture layer on top of RHI, allowing engine to build complex render pipeline with many passes.
* **FusionCore**: Widgets library used to build GUI applications with declarative syntax.
* **Fusion**: Adds more high level Fusion widgets like TreeView, ListView and more.

### System domain

System domain modules are at high level of the engine.

* **System**: The main module that contains the high level game engine systems, game framework, etc.
* **GameSystem**: Only for standalone builds. Runtime implementation of System module.

### Editor domain

Contains all the editor modules.

* **EditorCore**: Implements Asset processing and serves as the foundation of the editor & host tools.
* **EditorSystem**: Host/editor implementation of the System module i.e. Engine.
* **CrystalEditor**: Contains all the editor related GUI and features and uses Fusion for the widgets.
